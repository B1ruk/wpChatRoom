## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `io.b1ruk.start.whatsAppS` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Gradle plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/gradle-plugin/reference/htmlsingle/)
